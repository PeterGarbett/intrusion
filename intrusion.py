#
# 	Intrusion detection
#
#
#   Motion detector followed by using yolo to see if
#   given catagories are involved then saving of images
#   via scp - potentialy anywhere. Motion detection by itself
#   is prone to many false alarms when looking for people
#   with changing light and wind moving trees etc
#
#   Multiple tasks used, 3 main in image pipeline
#   This enables access to multiple cores.
#
# 		 q          ib
# 	generate -> analyse -> preserve
#
# 	Generate
# 	produces images from camera and does basic motion detection
# 	then passes  images with motion detected into queue "q"
#
# 	analyse
# 	Subjects image to yolo (You Only look Once) to see
# 	if it contains objects of interest (as defined in configuration file
#
# 	preserve
# 	saves file to filesystem and attempts transfer via scp
# 	manages space if we are running out by deleting oldest files
# 	renames file to local_ if transfer suceeeds. It should be possible
#   to daisy chain several devices together.
#
# 	reTransmit
# 	Try to send file again and rename with prefix 'local_' on success.
#
# 	Last two processes share access using a filesystem lock
#
# 	main code gets configuration values, defines queues, sets
# 	off processes then checks they are alive at intervals.
# 	Restart in case of error. The service file should restart
# 	the program.
#
# 	queue exhaustion is avoided by rate limitimg image generation.
# 	There should be a large swapspace set up which will result in
# 	slowdown but not error if this calculation is transiently incorrect.
#
# 	Multiple values can be changed via a configuration file.
# 	The main process calls these and then sets off the processes
# 	Some of these parameters therefore have to be global but the
# 	ammount they are shared is actually minimal
